```

## Features
- Fully implemented billing assistant with mock billing tools
- Integration with existing assistant network
- Support for:
  - Checking account balances
  - Viewing payment history
  - Updating payment methods

## Testing the Solution

1. Ensure your environment is set up:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the chat application:
   ```bash
   chainlit run chat.py
   ```

3. Try these example conversations:
   - "I need to check my current balance"
   - "Can you show me my recent payments?"
   - "I want to update my credit card information"
   - "I'm having trouble with my service" (should route to Technical Support)

## Implementation Details

### Billing Assistant (`agents/billing.py`)
- Implements three core billing tools:
  - `fetch_billing_details`: Get current balance and charges
  - `fetch_payment_history`: View recent payment transactions
  - `update_payment_method`: Update payment information

### Chat Integration (`chat.py`)
- Added billing assistant registration
- Maintains proper assistant routing order
- Ensures smooth handoffs between assistants

## Next Steps
1. Implement real database integration for billing data
2. Add support for generating billing statements
3. Implement secure payment method storage
4. Add support for multiple currencies and regions
